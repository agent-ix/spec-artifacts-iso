# 🐍 spec-artifacts-iso

> Filament Module: ISO-style spec artifacts (FR/NFR/StR/US/IT/TC/AC/CON) — unified-shape archetypes (frontmatter JSON Schemas + `body_extraction` asserts) with per-archetype authoring **skeletons** as the source of truth, validated by quire-rs. No render templates.

---

## 📐 Project Structure and Development Philosophy

- **Library Name:** `spec_artifacts_iso`
- **Layout:** Flat project layout (package at root, no `src/`)
- **Language:** Python 3.13+
- **Dependency Management:** [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- **Build and CI:** GitHub Actions
- **Publishing:** Google Artifact Registry (PyPI-compatible)

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** installed on your system
- **Poetry 2.x** installed (`pip install poetry` or [official installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
- **devpi-client** (optional, for local publishing): `pip install devpi-client`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and create venv
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint

# Build distribution
make build
```

---

## 📦 Build Process

- **Local Development**:
  - `make install` - Install dependencies in Poetry venv
  - `make test` - Run tests
  - `make format` - Auto-format code (Black + Ruff)
  - `make lint` - Run linting checks
- **Artifact Building**:
  - `make build` - Build wheel and sdist under `dist/`
- **Artifact Upload**:
  - Artifacts uploaded via `twine upload` in CI

---

## 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - Triggers: `push`, `pull_request`, `tag v*.*.*`
  - Runs tests and lint checks
  - Builds artifacts with `poetry build`
  - Publishes to Google Artifact Registry using `twine upload -r internal-pypi`

## 🏠 Local Development with Local PyPI

For local development and testing, you can publish packages to the local PyPI proxy.

### Prerequisites

1. **Local Kubernetes cluster** running with PyPI proxy:
   ```bash
   # In the local repo
   make up
   make pypi-up
   ```

2. **devpi-client** installed locally:
   ```bash
   pip install devpi-client
   ```

### Publishing Locally

```bash
make local-publish
```

### Installing from Local PyPI

```bash
pip install --index-url http://pypi.ix/root/dev/+simple/ spec_artifacts_iso
```

## 📜 Design Philosophy

- Native Poetry-based development (no Docker required for development)
- Isolated Poetry virtualenv (no global pip pollution)
- Direct uploads to Artifact Registry using correct PyPI-style authentication
- Always source-driven — no hand-editing built artifacts
- Dynamic, Git-tag-based versioning
- Clear Makefile and CI workflows matching production standards

# [US-001] Import an artifact with integrity verification

## Description

A user story describing an operator importing an artifact and relying on the
platform to verify its integrity automatically.

## Body

As an operator, I want the platform to verify the SHA-256 digest of an artifact
I import, so that I am confident the stored artifact exactly matches the bytes I
intended to upload and any corruption is surfaced immediately.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: StR-001 tamper-evident imports
- **Downstream**: FR-001 checksum verification on import

# [StR-001] Operators need tamper-evident artifact imports

## Description

This stakeholder requirement captures the operations team's need to detect any
corruption or tampering of artifacts as they enter the platform.

## Body

As platform operators, we require that every imported artifact be verified
against a declared cryptographic digest so that silent corruption or malicious
substitution is detected and rejected before the artifact is trusted by any
downstream system.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: platform security policy
- **Downstream**: FR-001 checksum verification on import

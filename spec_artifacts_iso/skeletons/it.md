# [IT-001] Checksum mismatch rejects the import

## Description

An integration test that imports an artifact whose declared digest does not match
its bytes and asserts the platform rejects the import end to end.

## Body

Given a running import service and an artifact whose declared SHA-256 digest is
deliberately wrong, when the artifact is submitted to the import endpoint, then
the service responds with a rejection error carrying both the declared and
computed digests, and no artifact row is persisted to the store.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: FR-001 checksum verification on import
- **Downstream**: none
